  description: `PUT SOLAR DYNAMICS is a solar race team which consists of 50
  students coming from 8 different study fields, running under the
  patronage of PoznanÂ University of Technology. Our main goal is to
  build racing cars powered by electrical energy, partially derived
  from solar energy. Those cars let us compete at the world class
  level tournaments and also promote renewable energy sources. We
  are hoping that our engagement will be a part of proecology
  changes around the world.
  Our team is all about the people. It consists of electricians,
  mechanicians, coders and marketing specialists, not only students
  but also EngD's and masters. Therefore personal development and
  communication are always on the first position, which provides us
  continuous growth. We believe that the practical experience gained
  through participation in our project will result in future
  professional success.`,
